============

My GitHub Repository - This is my final Project for CSCIE-190 utilizing AWS CodeDeploy and GitHub Repository. And, this is my overall "take-a-way" on this class; It was a great class! I learned a lot of new things from my Teacher, TAs, and fellow students. But, most importantly I learned that when nothing seems to work, step-away for a moment, and everything will come together. For me, I found that patient is truly a virtue! Great Class!
